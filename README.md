Project Title: Automated Network Reconnaissance using Nmap and Bash

Project Overview:
This project automates basic network scanning tasks using Nmap and Bash scripting. It is intended to help beginners understand how to gather network information, identify open ports, detect operating systems, and store results efficiently.

Objectives:

-Understand how Nmap is used in reconnaissance.

-Learn to write Bash scripts for automation.

-Build a tool that:

-Accepts an IP address or domain.

-Performs ping, port, and OS detection scans.

-Saves results into organized text files.

Tools and Technologies:

-Nmap (for network scanning)

-Bash (for scripting and automation)

-GitHub (for version control and sharing)

Folder Structure:

-nmap-bash-scanner/
-├── README.md
-├── scan.sh
-├── results/
-│   └── [targetname]_scan.txt
-└── LICENSE

How It Works:

-Run the scan.sh script.

-Enter a target IP address or domain when prompted.

-The script will:

-Perform a ping scan.

-Scan all ports.

-Detect the OS and service versions.

-Results are saved with a timestamp in the results/ directory.

Usage Instructions:

-chmod +x scan.sh
-./scan.sh

Script Code:


-#!/bin/bash

-echo "Welcome to Simple Nmap Bash Scanner"
-read -p "Enter the target IP or domain: " target

-if [[ -z "$target" ]]; then
    echo "Error: No target provided."
    exit 1
-fi

-mkdir -p results

-timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
-filename="results/${target}_${timestamp}_scan.txt"

-echo "Scanning host: $target"
-echo "Results will be saved in $filename"

-echo "Running Ping Scan..." | tee -a "$filename"
-nmap -sn "$target" | tee -a "$filename"

-echo -e "\nRunning Port Scan..." | tee -a "$filename"
-nmap -p- "$target" | tee -a "$filename"

-echo -e "\nRunning OS Detection and Service Version Scan..." | tee -a "$filename"
-nmap -A "$target" | tee -a "$filename"

-echo -e "\nScan completed. Check the file: $filename"

Project Milestones:

-Set up Nmap and Bash environment

-Write scan.sh script

-Test the script on different IPs and domains

-Upload project to GitHub

-Add optional advanced features like HTML report generation or email alerts
